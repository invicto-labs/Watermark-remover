# ClearPage local download website

Plan: INR 999 for **two** distinct PDF documents. Seller: Raysan sure.
Support: sales@zynape.com.

This is a buildless HTML/CSS site. The local preview is assembled under the task's
`outputs/ClearPage-website` directory. All four download buttons follow the public
GitHub latest-stable-release URL for `ClearPage-Windows-x64.zip`. Each verified
production release publishes this stable-name asset alongside its versioned ZIP.
No website edit or Render ZIP upload is needed for future releases. See
`AUTOMATIC-RELEASES.md`; the first compatible published release is required before
the public download link works. The local ZIP in outputs is available for review.

Nothing is published. Terms/privacy text is a draft. Custom cleanup includes the seller-requested
two-hour delivery-or-refund promise after receipt of complete requirements and any
requested sample. Enquiries prepare an email draft to sales@zynape.com; they do
not send email automatically. Checkout is disabled. Complete seller review, payment hosting,
and policy details before any public paid launch or Razorpay submission.

The locally built package is the Standard preview. It opens in its own Windows
application window using Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime, not a browser tab.
PDF contents stay on the customer computer during standard cleanup; online credit
verification uses installation IDs, document fingerprints and payment references.
Custom-support samples are shared only when the customer chooses to send them.
No absolute confidentiality guarantee is made about customer devices or samples.
The package excludes optional
LaMa and neural OCR models/runtimes. To reproduce a local Standard preview in a
clean Windows Python 3.12 environment with application requirements and PyInstaller:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run build
$env:CLEARPAGE_BUILD_STANDARD='1'
$env:CLEARPAGE_BUILD_PREVIEW='1'
python -m PyInstaller --noconfirm --clean ClearPage.spec
```

The preview flag explicitly permits an incomplete public `billing.json` for local
review. A commercial customer build must use complete public payment settings and
omit that flag. Keep the entire `_internal` directory beside the EXE, include
applicable dependency licenses, smoke-test the packaged executable, and ZIP the
whole application folder. Never bundle merchant secrets or seller signing keys.

The current Windows build requires online authorization. See HOSTING.md for the
Render deployment, persistent storage, secrets and build-order requirements.
